### Ansible

# Q. What is Ansible?
Ansible is a tool that helps automate tasks like setting up servers, installing software, and managing configurations. It doesnâ€™t need special software on the computers you're controlling, and it uses easy-to-read files (written in YAML) to define what tasks should be done. Ansible makes it simple to manage multiple machines at once, saving time and reducing errors.
